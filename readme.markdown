Hi,

This application is a browser game, build for facebook and live at https://apps.facebook.com/youngbasketballer/.   
Aim of the game was to develop a virtual basketball league, where a user can play as a team owner, coach or player.  

Application is built with php, on top of zend framework. It depends on [YBCore library](https://github.com/grandbora/youngbasketballer-Core) which holds the domain logic (models), and database abstraction layer. 
Database abstraction is implemented by utilizing Zend_Db_Table classes.
